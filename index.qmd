## 💼 Personal Summary

Hi! My name is Mao Yang and I come from the southwestern part of China. Now, I am a first-year ScM student at Biochemmistry and Molecular Biology Department. I am working on investigating therapy-resistance mechanisms of cancer cells and how aging promote this process.Outside of work, I enjoy hiking in the mountains, taking photos, fencing and keeping two cats, called Orangey and Mimi.

**Fun facts:**

-   My MBTI is INFJ

-   My glass is magnifying lens because I have presbyopia
